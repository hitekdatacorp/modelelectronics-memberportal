# This is the file used by "npm run build". Whenever you run build it always looks to this file. So depending on whether or not you want to
# deploy to STAGING or PRODUCTION, you'll have to copy the values from the .env.staging file or the .env.static.production file and paste it into this file
# This is because there is no way to tell the "npm run build" command which .env file to use. it always just uses .env.production.
